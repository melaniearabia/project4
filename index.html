They have turned it into a source to get their money instead fo actual hard work. It is teaches other and younger viewers that if they make videos about their life, then they will succeed when in fact, it is the exact opposite. Attention isn't always good unless you know how to control it. Bad media comes from popularity. it brings unwante viewers who are out to destroy the young minds channels and it leads to other bad outcomes.
