				<p>Austin proposed to Catherine on her birthday last year. He did this by giving her gifts all day and then going skydiving. This video is all scripted. Catherine would have worn a dress and heels if she didn't know what was going on. Plus, Austin is extremely scared of heights, so he wouldn't have done the skydiving if he hadn't had talked to her about the trip before hand, also including that their daughter came at the end but, Catherine has tabs on Elle on where she is. For her to come to them wouldn't be possible without her knowledge.</p>

				<p>When recording a video, viewers saw the drawer moving in the background and reported it as a "ghost". After that incident, the ACE Family has been faking other instances about the gost ansd claimed to have seen-with the camera pointing at the right time, them looking at the exact moment, and making the faces for the picture-a ghost.</p>

				<p>Catherine and Austin thought it was a good idea to sleep overnight at Toys R Us. After this video happened, many others started doing this "challenge" and started getting caught, or arrested. They influenced their fans so much that it led to bad consequences and the ACE Family takes no responsibility.</p>
