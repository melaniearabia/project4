				<p>The ACE Family decided to doa giveaway of a new car to a fan, however, this was a scam. it was proven that the "fan" who won was actually a relative of Catherine and the car was already hers, not a giveaway. This video was all for show and gave false hope to the fans that suppot their channel daily.</p>

				<p>In December of last year, the ACE Family decided to give away 1,000 dollars to a different fan every single day for the Holidays through a subscribe battle; this meaning that they gave away $31,000. Most of the fans who won said that they never got the money or heard from them, and others only got about half of the amount due to "complications". For those looking forward to a blessign of giving and hope were greatly dissappointed by the ACE Family.</p>

				<p>The ACE Family decided to have a couple fans sleepver the house and hang out, however, Elle was gone for that time period and the fan was forced to sleep on  completely different floor than Catherine and Austin. They showed the fan different "tricks" such as how to snek in food to a theatre which is not allowed by theatres. The fan later said in a video of his own that the sleepover wasn't all he had dreamed of and not happy with how close Catherine and Austin were being around him, as if he wasn't there.</p>
