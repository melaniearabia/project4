				<p>While it is said that Austin is the father of Elle, there is no proof that he the father. Their YouTube channel started after elle was bornm, plus Catherine and Austin were silenty for a period of time, including that Austin traveled for basketball. Austin and Elle have a somewhat close relationship but don't share smiliarities, except for moments. If Austin were the father, then Elle would be along with her other ethnicities, 1/4 black, whcih her blood results do not show from test.</p>

				<p>There is proof of Elle being the daughter of Catherine. She was forced to stop modeling due to her pregnancy and take a break to "support Austin". The mother and daughter have a very close relationship and share similarities. Elle shares so many similarites that Elle looks like a replica of Catherine when she was her age.</p>
